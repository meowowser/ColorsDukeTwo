<h1>MEOWSER EXPERIMENT: #0002: The search for a satisfying solution to change the Java console color window </h1>

<h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3> 

A (not so) simple console color exploration for Java console customization. To run [click here](https://replit.com/@meowser/ColorsDukeTwo).
<br>

**At this moment, this REPL "mimics" changing the Java console color.** The end goal is a real instead of faux display solution. 

<hr>

<h3>FUTURE-ish UPDATES</h3>

- Create a way to fill window with background color with no gaps
- Create a way for user input to select background color
- Investigate Java libraries that will allow me to control the console window color overall
  - And understand why its possible to change console background using them but not with direct Java. [This explantion may be a start](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2077406/a-splash-of-text-color-with-your-java.html).

<h3>GOAL(S):</h3>

- To learn how to make a Java library and how those things work... someday. *This is so annoying its making me want to learn how to make my own Java libray just for console color customization and nothing else.*
- To take what I learn and place it into a simple text RPG ... someday.
- To practice coding in a way that's fun, helps me grow my skills, and provides a break from the main programming stuff I'm learning. 

<h3>QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE</h3> 

- Am I using the proper search terms?
  - *I'm still a Java newb. Could be a case of I don't know what I don't know.*
<br><br>
- Can I overwrite "string" in some way so that when anything prints the first color set is the main color?
<br><br>
- Can I add change the ENTIRE Java console color instead of only text background output alone? 
  - *Deep Sighs*. [This answer says no](https://community.oracle.com/tech/developers/discussion/1231291/how-to-add-console-color), that you need to use a library. But it is my understanding that a library is a collection of frequently used methods which means it SHOULD be possible. I can't find a tutorial on this. 
<br><br>
- Can I create a gradient background effect?
<br><br>
- Can I figure out how to create a simple program that displays the background as a rainbow spectrum?
  - How about ombre/gradient tones?
  - How about grayscale?
  - What about controlling color of the cursor square?
<br><br>
- Can I figure out how to keep things nice and simple and tidy over messy but it works?
  - In other words can I balance learning how to make things happen with also learning good coding hygiene.
  - I get lost sometimes in over documenting in general (*deep sighs*).
<br><br>
- **META** Even if I figure out how to do the above can I understand and breakdown my own code to a stranger in a way it makes sense?
